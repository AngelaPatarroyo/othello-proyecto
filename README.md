	Rules/Requirements: 										
											
	1. Black player starts the Game 										
											
	2. If the board is 8 x 8 each payer starts with 32 tokesn each, if the board is 10 x 10 each player starts with 50 tokes each  										
											
	3. When you want to add a token, this can only be done if you put it in a tile that, 										
	     a- doesn't have another value (empty) and b- that is next to a token of the opponent										
											
	4. You can only put a token if apart from being next to a token from the oponnent there is at least one of your tokens in the same direction										
											
	5. When you put a token you must put it in a way that creates a chain, this means to change the tokens that are between your tokens 										
											
	6. The aim of the game is to flip the highest number of tokens on the board so you have those tokens on your color										
											
	7. The game ends if the player who has the turn doesn't have any more possible/allowed moves in which case the tokens on the board are counted										
	    and the one with the highest number wins the game  and the one with the highest number wins the game 										
											
	8. The other way the game ends is if one of the players get rid of the tokes given depending on the board size, 										
	     so the firts player who reaches 0 or less ont he scoreboard wins the game										
											





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
